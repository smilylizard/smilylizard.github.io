    <h1>Kill me now this is hard</h1>
    <p>Think about all the fucking possibilities. Someday is not a fucking day of the week. Creativity is a fucking work-ethic. To go partway is easy, but mastering anything requires hard fucking work. Remember it’s called the creative process, it’s not the creative fucking moment. Make your work consistent but not fucking predictable. What’s important is the fucking drive to see a project through no matter what. Practice won’t get you anywhere if you mindlessly fucking practice the same thing. Change only occurs when you work deliberately with purpose toward a goal. Respect your fucking craft. Learn from fucking criticism. The graphic designer’s first fucking consideration is always the size and shape of the format, whether for the printed page or for digital display. While having drinks with Tibor Kalman one night, he told me, “When you make something no one hates, no one fucking loves it.” This design is fucking brilliant. Sometimes it is appropriate to place various typographic elements on the outside of the fucking left margin of text to maintain a strong vertical axis. This practice is referred to as exdenting and is most often used with bullets and quotations. Use your fucking hands. To surpass others is</p>
